/*
 * Swift (in its current state) appears to be lacking the option to easily switch
 * between certain types -- especially when it comes to using C Types / Pointers
 * These conversion functions are here to augment and remove those limitations
 *
 * These functions will be removed as they are no longer needed
 * I recommend you try not to rely on them existing
