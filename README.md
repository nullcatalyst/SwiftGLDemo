SwiftGLDemo
===========

This is an example project designed to showcase how to use the [SwiftGL](https://github.com/sbennett912/SwiftGL) library.

At the moment, this example shows how to load some Shaders from a couple of files, as well as loading a Vertex Buffer Object (VBO) with vertices, fills another with the indices denoting which vertices to render in which order, and bind both into a Vertex Array Object (VAO). This is done to render a spinning colorful cube to the screen.
