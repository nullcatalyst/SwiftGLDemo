SwiftGLDemo
===========

This is an example project designed to showcase how to use the [SwiftGL](https://github.com/sbennett912/SwiftGL) library.

At the moment, this example shows how to load some Shaders from a couple of files, as well as loading a Vertex Buffer Object (VBO) and Vertex Array Object (VAO) which are then used to render a white square on a black background.
